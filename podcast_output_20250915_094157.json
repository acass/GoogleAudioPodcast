  "text": "Speaker 1: So, we're talking about integrating Zebra mobile computing into a breeding application, right?  The transcription is... a bit dense, to say the least.  But the core seems to be about setting up the prerequisites.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly. It sounds like a complex process. From what I gather,  we need to address several key areas before we can even start using Zebra devices for breeding flow analysis.  First, there's the camera integration. It mentions needing camera feeds \u2013 potentially from multiple sources \u2013 for data acquisition.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, and it highlights the importance of correctly configuring the application manifest. It sounds like we need to specify various attributes within the manifest to ensure compatibility and proper functionality with the Zebra devices and other external sources.  This part about \"external general predicament using cemex\" sounds a bit vague, though.  I\u2019m not sure what that refers to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Agreed, that's a bit of a mystery. But it then dives into defining 'Morgan's,' which seems to be some kind of crucial data set or group that needs to be correctly identified and included in the system.  Apparently, knowing more about the latest versions and releases of this \"Morgan's\" is key. It seems intimately tied to Zebra's sticky and bucket configurations.\n\nSpeaker 1:  I think the whole \"sticky and buckets\" refers to data storage and management somehow.   And then there's the challenge of connecting this \"Morgan's\" data to the breeding records \u2013 making sure there\u2019s no data loss or mismatch between the Zebra device data and the existing system. The transcription mentions ensuring the data aligns, or else it's \"stuck on Bob Seger,\" which I assume is just an idiom for a data bottleneck.\n\nSpeaker 2: Haha,  that's a colourful metaphor!  Beyond that, there\u2019s mention of  specific \"attributes\" needing to be defined in the manifest \u2013 things like the date and time, perhaps.  And then there's a reference to  \"doctor third grade class a lot,\" which is completely baffling.  I think we need to get clarification on that one.  \n\nSpeaker 1: Definitely! And there's talk of \"God and god or critics and sins\"\u2014another cryptic reference, I suspect. We also need to define \"deep in the mormons\" \u2013 whatever *that* means in this context!  The transcription ends with a suggestion to visit the \"ghost of the burger court\" which, again, is probably not literal.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's definitely a colourful and confusing transcription! In short,  the key takeaways are:  proper camera feed integration, careful configuration of the application manifest, understanding and integrating \"Morgan's\" data, and ensuring data consistency between Zebra devices and existing records.   But we need to clarify some of these strange references before we can fully understand the procedure.  This is clearly not your average breeding application setup.\n",
